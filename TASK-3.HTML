    Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal</h2> </center>                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <ul><li>     <pre> Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal (Urdu: محمد اقبال; 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938) was a philosopher,[1] South Asian Muslim writer,[2][3] scholar and politician,[4] whose poetry in the Urdu language is considered among the greatest of the twentieth century,[5][6][7][8] and whose vision of a cultural and political ideal for the Muslims of the British Raj[9] was to animate the impulse for Pakistan.[2][10] He is commonly referred to by the honorific Allama[11] (from Arabic, through Persian: علامہ, romanized: ʿallāma, lit. 'very knowing, most learned').[12</LI]</UL></pre>

                                    <pre>  Born and raised in Sialkot, Punjab, Iqbal completed his B.A. and M.A. at the Government College Lahore.                                                              <br><ul value="square">  <li>  He taught Arabic at the Oriental College, Lahore from 1899 until 1903. During this time, he wrote prolifically.</li> </ul>                             Among the Urdu poems from this time that remain popular are Parinde ki faryad (A bird's prayer), an early meditation on animal rights, and Tarana-e-Hindi (The Song of Hindustan) a patriotic poem—both poems composed for children.                                                 <br>  In 1905, he left for further studies in Europe, first to England, where he completed a second B.A. at Trinity College, Cambridge and was subsequently called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and then to Germany, where he received a Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Munich.</pre>  <ul>  <li>                                                After returning to Lahore in 1908, he established a law practice but concentrated on writing scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy, and religion. He is best known for his poetic works, including Asrar-e-Khudi – after whose publication he was awarded a knighthood,[13] Rumuz-e-Bekhudi, and the Bang-e-Dara. In Iran, where he is known as Iqbāl-e Lāhorī (Iqbal of Lahore), he is highly regarded for his Persian works.</li></ul>
    
   <ul><li></li> Iqbal regarded Rumi as his Guide and Ashraf Ali Thanwi as the greatest living authority on the matter of Rumi's teachings.[14][15] He was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic civilisation across the world, but in particular in South Asia; a series of lectures he delivered to this effect were published as The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam.<br></li></ul>l Iqbal was elected to the Punjab Legislative Council in 1927 and held a number of positions in the All India Muslim League.<br><ul><li> In his 1930 presidential address at the League's annual meeting in Allahabad, he formulated a political framework for Muslims in British-ruled India.<br></li></ul>[9] Iqbal died in 1938. After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, he was named the national poet there. He is also known as the "Hakeem-ul-Ummat" ("The Sage of the Ummah") and the "Mufakkir-e-Pakistan" ("The Thinker of Pakistan"). The anniversary of his birth (Yom-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl), 9 November, used to be a public holiday in Pakistan until 2018.[16] Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi wrote Glory of Iqbal to introduce him to the Arab world.[17][18]
